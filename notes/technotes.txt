blueprints buildings/unit spaces in buildings
fabs/assembler
labs
refinery
etc

users list of known blueprints

materials list  (harvested by bots)

fabs (fabricators make parts from blueprints) [can fabs be linked to make production line?]

labs (like fabricators labs make parts, but modify blueprint to try and get a new variant.)

bots (composits of parts made by fabs)

refineries (turn raw materials into usable materials)

bulk is abstract concept of size and weight combined. Items with more bulk may be larger, or heavier than items with less bulk, exactly what an how is irrelevant

systems timer - take a date timestamp (for an event like move bot), add delay (calc second timestamp). When system time is after delayTime then fire event again.

With the move mechanic (bot moves 1 'away' from base each cycle), there is the possibility of establishing a second (and more) bases x units away from the first base. (would require a construction bot or bots)

bots left outside rot.
